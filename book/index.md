# Radio-Frequency shimming in Magnetic Resonance Imaging

This Jupyter Book aims to present the main physical and mathematical principles at play in $B_1^+$ shimming applications. 

```{note}
This document has an educational purpose only. The algorithms presented here correspond to basic $B_1^+$ shimming methods and
 do not reflect the current state-of-the-art RF-shimming that can be found in literature.
