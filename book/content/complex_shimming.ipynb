    "## Energy deposition and SAR constraint\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw earlier, performing RF-shimming modifies the current sent to each transmit element and might result in RF \"hotspots\". When applying an RF electromagnetic field to a patient, its electric component induces heat dissipation in the tissues, wich might be dangerous if the temperature rise becomes too important. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to perfom MRI scans safely, we thus limit the energy deposition in the patient. This is done by monitoring the **Specific Absorbtion Rate (SAR)**, which corresponds to the rate at which the energy is absorbed per unit mass of tissue. This is the same metric that the one used to monitoring the RF emissions of mobile phones, and it is usually expressed in watts per kilogram (W/kg).\n",
    "\n",
    "As of today, no perfectly accurate method has been developped in order to measure the SAR during in-vivo MR experiments. For this reason, SAR estimations are based on sophisticated modeling of the coil/body system.\n",
    "\n",
    "In MRI, the SAR is computed globally and locally, using the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "  SAR = w^HQw\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $w$ is a complex vector of length $C$ (shim weights) and $Q$ is a matrix of size $(C\\times C)$ where C is the number of transmit channels. $Q$ is determined through EM simulations, based on each channel's electric field distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "As $Q$ does not correspond to in-vivo measurements, a safety factor is usually applied in order to safely consider the differences between the simulated and actual experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Global SAR\n",
    "\n",
    "The global SAR is the total power absorbed by the whole body divided by the weight of the whole\n",
    "body. It is limited to 2W/kg by the IEC standard 60601-2-33. It is usually measured by the scanner during the scan, and pulse sequences are interrupted if the limit value is exceded. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Local SAR\n",
    "\n",
    "The local SAR aims to limit the energy deposition in small portions of the body. During the simulation process, a Q matrix will be computed for every 10g of tissues and the limit value will be larger than for global shimming (tyically 10W/kg for the head and trunk, and 20W/kg for the extremities), in order to take the existence of local SAR hotspots into account. \n",
    "\n",
    "### SAR and Ultra High Field imaging\n",
    "\n",
    "SAR is proportional to $\\omega_0^2$, meaning that the energy deposition at 7T is ~5 times higher than at 3T. SAR constraints will thus become even more challenging at UHF in order to ensure patient's safety. Local SAR will be particularly constraining as the arising of SAR hotspots becomes frequent due to the use of several Tx elements positioned close to the patient.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Virtual observation points\n",
    "\n",
    "Virtual Observation Points (VOP) are matrices used to reduce the number of Q-matrices considered during the optimization process. The principle is that the Q-matrices corresponding to all the 10g tissues are gathered in different subgroups (VOP) based on their similarities. The larger the subgroup, the less VOPs will be used for optimization, thereby accelerating the optimization process. \n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "If we want a very small number of VOPs, we have to increase the subgroup size, i.e., reduce the accuracy of the SAR computation. This might result in SAR overestimations and overconstrained optimizations (sacrificing homogeneity for lower SAR).\n",
